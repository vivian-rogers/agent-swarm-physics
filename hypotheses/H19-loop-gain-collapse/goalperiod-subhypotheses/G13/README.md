# H19 × G13: Design, run and write up a human subjects experiment (2025-09-08 → 2025-09-19)

**Verdict:** supported
**Verdict (1b):** mixed (round 1b, 2026-10-04, corrected data, pre-registered E1; with the day-edge-adjusted activity gain: supported; round 1: supported)
**Role:** exploratory (round 1, non-holdout)
**Period:** regime I · mode C · 6.0 agents (N_room 6.0) · 1 room(s) carrying ≥ 5% of agent messages · 10 non-holdout days · 3.0 h/day (empirical).

## Why this period
One point on every method's curve. Loop-gain estimates available here: H03 n̂ ALL (T2), H03 n̂ TALK (T1, primary), H03 fast n_x (T3), H04 K, weekly (E3), H04 n, weekly (T4), g_eq active (E1, primary), g_eq talk (E2). Controls: x_att = 0.85 (rank 12/35), messages per village turn 0.97, attention load k̄ = 4.9 agent messages waiting per turn, 25.5 agent messages per agent-hour, human share of chat 1.1%.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 00:09 UTC, before H19 related any control parameter to any loop gain (the card's P1 applied here).*
- Under the attention-dilution collapse (P1), every loop gain is affine-increasing in x_att. This period's x_att = 0.85 is **below** the cross-period median (0.96), so its estimates should sit **below** each method's cross-period median, and on the common curve.
- **Per-period verdict rule** (fixed now): fit the primary collapse model (per-method affine in x_att) without this period (LOPO). **supported** if (i) both primary estimates (T1 n̂ TALK, E1 g_eq active) fall inside their 90% LOPO predictive intervals and (ii) the period's summed LOPO log density under the collapse model is ≥ that under the regime-only rival N1; **mixed** if exactly one of (i), (ii) holds; **failed** if neither.
- Against it: estimates outside the intervals in the direction opposite to the x_att prediction, or N1 predicting the period better.

## Result
Primary collapse model (per-method affine in x_att), fitted without G13 (LOPO); shrunken = partial-pooling (BLUP) estimate under the collapse model fitted to all periods, shown beside the period's own estimate.

- (i) both primaries inside their 90% intervals: **True**; (ii) summed LOPO log density, collapse 6.44 vs regime-only 6.39: **True**.
- Direction check (prediction: below median): primaries observed n_talk above, geq_active below.
- Per-period figure: `figures/G13_residuals.png`. Data: `data/processed/H19-loop-gain-collapse/G13/residuals.parquet`.

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
- **C** (adequacy vs. rivals, this period): collapse vs. regime-only log density +0.05 nats.
- **D** (unfitted): the period's estimates are predicted out of sample (LOPO), not fitted.
- E, G: not informed by a single period.

## Round 1b (improved data, 2026-10-04)
H19's own gains re-estimated on `activity_bins_fixed` (+ `outages_fixed`), H02/H03 inputs from their round-1b runs; H04's K_week and H05's gains (built on the buggy table, not yet re-run by their owners) are dropped. "DQ8 trim": all-present window, explained joint silences removed; "H38-conditioned": agent-state conditioning of day edges, infra errors and consolidations.

| Method | Round 1 | **Round 1b** | Round-1b LOPO prediction [90% PI] (raw E1 run) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 g_eq active (raw) | 0.030 | **0.101 ± 0.041** | 0.146 [-0.028, 0.320] |
| E1 g_eq active, DQ8 trim | – | **0.051 ± 0.041** | – |
| E1 g_eq active, H38-conditioned | – | **0.076 ± 0.043** | – |
| E2 g_eq talk | 0.121 | **0.102 ± 0.022** | 0.187 [0.021, 0.354] |
| T1 n̂ TALK | 0.574 | **0.570 ± 0.030** | 0.410 [0.064, 0.756] |
| T3 fast n_x | 0.024 | **0.025 ± 0.020** | 0.086 [0.016, 0.155] |

Per-period rule (unchanged): (i) both primaries inside their LOPO 90% intervals: raw run True, trim run True; (ii) log density ≥ regime-only rival: raw False (5.06 vs 5.09), trim True.
