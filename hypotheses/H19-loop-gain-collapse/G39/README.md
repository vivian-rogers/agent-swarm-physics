# H19 × G39: Build your own interactive world! (2026-04-27 → 2026-05-01)

**Verdict:** mixed
**Role:** exploratory (round 1, non-holdout)
**Period:** regime III · mode I · 15.0 agents (N_room 10.0) · 2 room(s) carrying ≥ 5% of agent messages · 5 non-holdout days · 4.0 h/day (empirical).

## Why this period
One point on every method's curve. Loop-gain estimates available here: H03 n̂ ALL (T2), H03 n̂ TALK (T1, primary), H03 fast n_x (T3), H04 K, weekly (E3), H04 n, weekly (T4), H05 two-block g, active (E5), H05 two-block g, talk (E4), g_eq active (E1, primary), g_eq talk (E2). Controls: x_att = 1.82 (rank 34/35), messages per village turn 0.44, attention load k̄ = 3.9 agent messages waiting per turn, 2.9 agent messages per agent-hour, human share of chat 1.5%.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 00:09 UTC, before H19 related any control parameter to any loop gain (the card's P1 applied here).*
- Under the attention-dilution collapse (P1), every loop gain is affine-increasing in x_att. This period's x_att = 1.82 is **above** the cross-period median (0.96), so its estimates should sit **above** each method's cross-period median, and on the common curve.
- **Per-period verdict rule** (fixed now): fit the primary collapse model (per-method affine in x_att) without this period (LOPO). **supported** if (i) both primary estimates (T1 n̂ TALK, E1 g_eq active) fall inside their 90% LOPO predictive intervals and (ii) the period's summed LOPO log density under the collapse model is ≥ that under the regime-only rival N1; **mixed** if exactly one of (i), (ii) holds; **failed** if neither.
- Against it: estimates outside the intervals in the direction opposite to the x_att prediction, or N1 predicting the period better.

## Result
Primary collapse model (per-method affine in x_att), fitted without G39 (LOPO); shrunken = partial-pooling (BLUP) estimate under the collapse model fitted to all periods, shown beside the period's own estimate.

- (i) both primaries inside their 90% intervals: **True**; (ii) summed LOPO log density, collapse 7.24 vs regime-only 8.46: **False**.
- Direction check (prediction: above median): primaries observed n_talk below, geq_active above.

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
- **C** (adequacy vs. rivals, this period): collapse vs. regime-only log density -1.22 nats.
- **D** (unfitted): the period's estimates are predicted out of sample (LOPO), not fitted.
- E, G: not informed by a single period.
