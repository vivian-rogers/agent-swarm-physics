# H89 × G02: Unsupervised agents look back on their previous goal and forward to their next (2025-05-10 → 2025-05-12)

**Verdict:** n/a
**Role:** replication
**Period:** regime I · mode F · 4 agents · non-holdout days only (held-out days masked with `holdout_mask`).

## Why this period
Replication layer: the common H89 estimator (cross-fitted Price partition of day-to-day change of the active population's mean trait) on every non-holdout period with H34 ideas, so periods compare as points on a phase diagram.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 20:35 UTC, before running on this period* (after the card's predictions at 20:15 UTC and amendments A1–A5 at 20:30 UTC; no real-data Price share had been computed for any period).

| # | Prediction here | Counts against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| c1 (P1) | style moves more by migration than content does: s_Mig(style) > s_Mig(content, bge) | s_Mig(style) ≤ s_Mig(content) |
| c2 (P2) | content moves by transmission: s_Trans(content, bge) ≥ 0.5 and the largest term | s_Trans < 0.5 or another term larger |
| c3 (P3) | selection is not a material share: \|s_Sel\| ≤ 0.2 for content, style and conventions | \|s_Sel\| > 0.2 for any reliable trait |
| P5 | residual R (content) ≥ 0.1 with jackknife CI > 0 | CI includes 0 (migration + kickoff explain the change) |
| P6 | persistence C (content) > 0 with CI > 0 (periods with ≥ 4 transitions) | C ≤ 0 |

**Verdict rule (card, A1):** supported = c1, c2 and c3; failed = none; mixed = otherwise; n/a = not eligible (< 2 transitions with ≥ 3 stayers or < 20 in-cone adoptions by stayers) or content or style reliability ρ_Δ < 0.3. P5 and P6 are reported, not voted here.

## Result
**n/a.** Not eligible: 1 transitions with ≥ 3 stayers, 14 in-cone adoptions by stayers (rule: ≥ 2 and ≥ 20).

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
Not informed (n/a).
