# H128 × G30: Adopt a park and get it cleaned! (2026-02-09 → 02-13)

**Verdict:** supported
**Role:** exploratory (replication)
**Period:** regime I · mode C · 11 agents · #general · 5 days. Kickoff code: free (open or objective only).

## Why this period
Regime-I week with a dense work ledger; free objective (the park is chosen). Few repos (H93: 2), so it may be descriptive.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 22:19 UTC, before running H128 on this period.*
- Kickoff code: free. HH369 (card P1): N_p falls as a power law after its peak, α̂'s CI overlaps [0.3, 0.5], t_f > 3 active h; merges are ≥ half of project deaths (P4).
- My expectation: slow settling (t_f > 3 h) is likelier than a clean power law; deaths by finish (expiry) may dominate.
- Counts against: a freeze (t_f ≤ 3 h, constant or step).
- Verdict rule: supported if power law selected, α̂ CI overlaps [0.3, 0.5] (where identified) and t_f > 3 h; mixed if slow (t_f > 3 h) but not a power law in the band; failed if frozen (t_f ≤ 3 h); descriptive if untestable (N_pk < 4, < 6 hosts, or H < 10 h).

## Result
*Run 2026-10-04 22:44 UTC (`scheme/build.py`, `analysis/run.py`; non-holdout days; first 20.0 active h).* Primary observable dw = (N_p − 1)/(N_h − 1) (Amendment A1); N_p is the HH-literal secondary.

| Unit | Code | dw class / shape | t_f (active h) | A_u (h) | α̂ on dw [95% boot] | N_p (HH-literal) class / shape; merge share; deaths | dw drift per h (post hoc A2) | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G30 | free | slow / power | 4.75 (jk SE 17.8) | 0.78 | 0.44 [0.32, 0.60] | freeze / constant, c_m 0.27 {'merge': 3, 'hop_new': 0, 'finish': 8} | -0.019 (τ -0.31, p 0.000) | supported |

Synthetic validity on this skeleton (A1 rule): valid (Q0 not frozen True, fields freeze True, finish not coarsening True; α identified True).

Data: `data/processed/H128-coarsening-vs-freeze/G30/` (curve, deaths); figure: `../../figures/summary_obs.pdf`.

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
- **C:** freeze baseline (t_f ≤ 3 h) and shape fits (constant/step/exponential/power, BIC).
- **D:** death kinds (merge vs finish) are unfitted; read share of merges 0.00.
- **F:** real-skeleton synthetic (5 worlds × 60 runs): valid for dw.
