# H114 × G12: goal period #12

**Verdict:** failed
**Role:** replication (exploratory)
**Period:** goal #12 · regime I · units 12a · 4 non-holdout days · 7 authors.

## Why this period
Eligible for the replication layer (≥ 300 agent messages and ≥ 100 DQ2 agent-to-agent parent links in at least one unit).

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 21:51 UTC, before running on this period (after Amendment A1). No H114 statistic seen.*
The card's per-period rule on the random-effects pool of its units: supported if Δh > 0 (CI excluding 0), the period has ≥ 1 strong pair (lower bound of g_ij > 0.5, R_ij ≥ 10) and the strong-pair cut brings Δh′ within CI of 0 and below the 5th percentile of matched random cuts; failed if Δh's CI includes 0 or lies below 0 (tail not heavier than geometric), or if Δh > 0 with no strong pair (the HH's kill); mixed if strong pairs exist but do not carry the excess; descriptive with fewer than 100 links or fewer than 30 messages at depth ≥ 4. The card expects Δh > 0 (credence 0.75) and strong pairs in only about a third of units (0.35); A1: a missing strong pair rules out only pairs with g ≳ 0.7.

## Result
*Run 2026-10-04 ~21:55 UTC (non-holdout units).* Period pool (random effects over usable units): **Δh = 0.221 [0.080, 0.362]**, δh = 0.039 [-0.115, 0.194], 0 strong directed pairs in 0 unit(s), the cut carries the excess in 0. Verdict by the card's rule: **failed**.
