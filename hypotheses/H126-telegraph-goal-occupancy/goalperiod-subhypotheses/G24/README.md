# H126 × G24: goal #24 (2025-12-22 → 2025-12-26)

**Verdict:** descriptive
**Role:** exploratory
**Period:** regime I · mode C · 10 agents · units 24 · 2025-12-22 → 2025-12-26.

## Why this period
An assigned (non-free) goal period outside the holdout: the goal field should hold the on-goal occupancy at 0.1–0.5 (H105), so both dwell types are observed.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 ~22:25 UTC, before running on this period.*
Replication layer (card P1–P3, per unit 24):
- **P1 exponential dwells:** held-out-day ΔLL(M4s − M2a) per statement ≤ its parametric-bootstrap 95th percentile, or the M4s dwell CV < 2 in both states. Heavy-tailed (both conditions violated) counts against; it is the kill if it happens in > ½ of all units.
- **P2 dwells predict occupancy:** the held-out-day predicted agent-window occupancy is within 20% of the observed (|ρ_p| ≤ ln 1.2); off by > 30% counts against (kill if in > ½ of all units).
- **P3 kickoff (if this period has an eligible kickoff design from #23):** Δln k_on 90% CI above 0 and Δln k_off CI containing 0.
- Expectation for this period: regime I, mode C, N ≈ 10. Regime I/II: statements are dense on the call clock (median gap 1–4 calls).
- Unit verdict: supported if P1 and P2 hold; failed if heavy-tailed or |ρ_p| > ln 1.3; mixed otherwise. P3 is reported separately.

## Result
*Run 2026-10-04 (UTC), after Amendment A1. bge_small, deduplicated, call clock, M2a with jointly fitted emissions. P1, P2 are descriptive after A1 (P2's kill kept); P3 is the primary test. Period verdict after A1: failed if P3 counts against (k_off, or both rates move) or the P2 kill (|ρ_p| > ln 1.3) holds in > ½ of the units; supported if P3 = k_on; descriptive otherwise.*
