# H<NN>: <one-line title>

**Status:** idea | specified | running | supported | refuted | parked
**Fields:** <dynamics, stat mech, info theory, sociophysics, epidemics, thermodynamics>
**Literature:** <links to literature/*.md>
**Definitions used:** <terms from physics-models/DEFINITIONS.md, with variant names if any>

## Question
<What do you want to know, in one or two sentences.>

## Model
**From:** `physics-models/<NN-slug>/`
<Which variant of that model this hypothesis uses, its parameters, and what it
predicts here. E.g. "SIS with spontaneous adoption field ε; λ, γ, ε fit per regime.">

## Data scheme (`scheme/`)
<How raw data becomes the processed dataset this hypothesis uses.>
- **Inputs:** <raw tables and fields>
- **Transform:** <steps>
- **Output:** `data/processed/H<NN>-<slug>/` (<files and columns>)
- **Regimes covered:** <which time intervals; see physics-models/DEFINITIONS.md "Regime">

## Observables
<The quantities computed from the processed data that the model makes predictions about.>

## Null / baseline
<What you'd see if the effect isn't there. E.g. shuffled timestamps, model with β = 0, independent agents.>

## Faithfulness scorecard
Scored per model, mapping and window; 0 = not done or failed, 1 = partial, 2 = passed. Scheme and promotion thresholds: `writeup/paper.tex`, Sec. "Assessing model faithfulness".
**Rival models:** <the models that predict differently here>
**Locked holdout used for confirmation:** <goal periods / NEs>

| Axis | Test | Score | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A mapping | variables defined from dataset fields; assumptions listed; invariant across families and regimes | | |
| B assumptions | stationarity, Markov order, time-rescaling, update-order audit | | |
| C adequacy | beats the null hierarchy, day-blocked held-out data | | |
| D unfitted predictions | unfitted statistics and the model's signature | | |
| E interventional | predicts the change across a natural experiment | | |
| F identifiability | synthetic recovery with village sampling; robust to preprocessing | | |
| G ground truth | agrees with known structure | | |
| H comparative | beats the named rivals | | |
| I transfer | holds in other same-mode periods, including the holdout | | |

## Prediction
*Written <YYYY-MM-DD>, before running the analysis on real data.*
<What the model predicts for the observables, and what result would count against it.>

## Results
<Filled in after analysis. Link to analysis/ and figures/.>

## Notes
<Dated notes, dead ends, decisions.>
