# H31 × G33: Discuss, debate, and act on your views about the recent Pentagon-AI company news (2026-03-02 → 2026-03-05)

**Verdict:** descriptive
**Role:** exploratory (E-P + E-C)
**Period:** regime II · mode C · 12 agents · #general · 3 non-holdout days (12.0 active h).

## Why this period
H11 project labels are dense enough for E-P (≥ 50% of room-windows have ≥ 3 labeled agents).

**Predictors** (whole block-period; computed before any outcome):

| Block | N_b | msgs/h | u (reads/h) | λ₂^w,sym (1/h) | λ₂^w,dir | u·λ₂^rw | γ_tr | τ_wave (min) | τ_Vsim (h) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #general | 11 | 148 | 58.0 | 88.31 | 146.73 | 58.8 | 12.60 | 0.4 | 0.082 |

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-03, before running on this period.*

- **Card rules apply unchanged** (E-P, E-V, E-C definitions; tests T1–T7). Per-period verdicts are descriptive; the scaling test (P1, P5) is cross-period.
- **H31 (model D):** if this block's events are uncensored, their τ should sit on the cross-period line τ = c/λ₂^w,sym. Blocks with a larger λ₂^w,sym should be faster.
- **My prior (card):** the timing is set by task structure and announcements, so this period's τ will not track λ₂ beyond noise. E-P rises will be mostly abrupt (ρ ≤ 1 window), and E-C, if present, will be a convergence over days (τ_C 2–15 h).
- **Counts against H31 here:** uncensored events whose τ is far off the calibrated line (outside the 80% LOPO interval), or a room contrast with the opposite sign to D.

## Result
| Block | E-P projects | consensus (frozen at start / instant / uncensored) | τ_P (h), uncensored | rise (windows) | kick-locked | M_λ forecast (h) | M0 forecast (h) | E-C kind | E-C τ (h) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #general | 2 | 2 (1 / 1 / 0) | – | – | 1/2 | – | – | none | – |
- No uncensored E-P event: 1 frozen at the period start (kick-locked by construction) and 1 *instant* (criterion met in the onset window mid-period: a one-window herding wave). By the card's rule both are left-censored, so there is no τ to test.

Data: `data/processed/H31-consensus-time-spectral-gap/G33/`, `events_ep_w30.parquet`, `events_ec.parquet`.

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
- **C (period level):** the per-event leave-one-period-out comparison of M_λ (or M_tr) vs the constant is listed above.
- **G:** no external ground truth for consensus timing in this period.
