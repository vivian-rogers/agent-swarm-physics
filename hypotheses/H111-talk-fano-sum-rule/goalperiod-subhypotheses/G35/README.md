# H111 × G35: goal period #35

**Verdict:** descriptive
**Role:** replication (exploratory)
**Period:** goal #35 · regime II · mean present N 12.0 · units 35 · 5 non-holdout days.

## Why this period
Eligible for the replication layer: H67 measured a read-out loop gain g_lag for every unit of this period, so the sum rule gives a parameter-free prediction here.

## Prediction
*Written 2026-10-04 21:41 UTC, before running on this period (after Amendment A1). No H111 statistic seen.*
The card's per-period rule on the random-effects pooled r_F = Φ_obs(10)/Φ_pred(g_lag): supported if r_F ∈ [0.8, 1.2]; failed if r_F ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5; mixed otherwise; descriptive with fewer than 40 usable windows or a Φ CI wider than 1.0. g_lag ≈ 0 in regime II (H67), so the sum rule predicts Φ ≈ 1.

| Unit | H67 g_lag [95%] | ≈ 1/(1 − g_lag)² (room-adjusted value computed in the run) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 35 | 0.046 [0.016, 0.073] | 1.10 |

## Result
*Run 2026-10-04 ~21:45 UTC (non-holdout units; per-call clock, Amendment A1).* Period pool (random effects over units): **Φ(10) = 2.03 [0.80, 3.27]**, Φ_pred = 1.10, **r_F = 1.86 [0.93, 3.71]**; 101 usable 10-min windows. Verdict by the card's rule: **descriptive**.

| Unit | windows (10 min) | Φ(10) [95%] per-call | Φ(10) wall | Φ_pred(g_lag) | r_F [95%] | Φ(5) → Φ(30) | Φ untrimmed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 35 | 101 | 2.03 [0.88, 3.11] | 1.75 | 1.10 | 1.86 [0.81, 2.88] | 1.64 → 0.80 | 2.12 |

## Scorecard (period-specific axes)
C (Φ vs the block-shift null), D (the sum rule is unfitted).
